I first came across the idea of first principles from Elon Musk, and it struck like something amazing. It has been around 5 years since I came across that idea, and to be honest, I don't really think I have been able to actually utlize that idea to the fullest. The idea of building something from first principles is no doubt, absolutely fascinating and difficult to grasp; but it is truly worth it, at least I feel that. 

## so what are first principles
I don't know is the best first answer. If I am forced to give an answer, it would be asking questions until we no assumptions are left. Let's try this exercise with a simple question: 
### why do we drink water?
- first answer that comes to my mind is, because we are made up of water. 
- so does that mean, our composition more or less remains the same throughout our life. also, if we are made up of water , how can we verify that? 
- let me a do quick google search to verify the claim : 
    ` are we actually made up of water`
    - so yes, the claim that we are made up of water is pretty accurate. 
    - but the answer that we need water because we are made up of water is somewhat tautological (is that right phrasing; idk)
    - let's dive deeper
- when we say something is made up of this , does that automatically imply that it constantly requires this (very absurd phrasing)
- I am not sure about the above claim
- are we moving in the right direction; I think I am lost
- let me switch back to the same topic
- why do we need water
- what function does water serve that some other fluid can't 
- okay, this is an interesting segway; so in order to answer this question; we have to understand what water does in the body
- let me do another search 
    - this revealed far more than I expected
    - water is far more important than I thought (first thought, but not really a well thought out conclusion)
    - water acts as a universal solvent (heavy words), temperature regulation, waste elimination  ,key component in blood and other bodily fluids ( too much info)
    - first questoin that comes my mind is ; what other options do we have other than water for this, let me look it up
    - did a gpt search
        - no practical alt in short, but if we seriously have to : it is ammonia, formadide, methanol/ethanol mixture
        - we need to get a basic idea about why these options were listed over water
- this is going to be a pretty long exercise. but I guess , I got the idea.
