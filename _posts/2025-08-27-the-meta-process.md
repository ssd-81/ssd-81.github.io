I am currently learning algorithms, and most of the time I feel if I really know anything, I write solutions by copying , taking hints, writing brute force solutions and just managing at times. This made me question whether what I am doing is right; and the problem starts there. 
This idea of having  a perfect plan to iterate is fundamentally wrong ( I have been a victim of this idea again and again); but I would still like to dive deeper into this matter to actually get to know my process and actually challenge it. 

Few ideas I really want to embibe, they will change too, but for now they are really important:
- **systems crush intensity every single time**
- **difficulty is a design and very fundamental to learning something real**
